To start the system (GUI) and monitor the GPS drone from your personal laptop/PC you have to follow the steps below :

1- Update the Wi-Fi credentials on the esp32-gps.ino use the same Wi-Fi used in the PC and upload it on ESP32.
2- Use the IPCHECKER.ino file to obtain the esp32 ip address.
3- Update the tk5.py file with the new ip address.
4- Run the tk5.py from the command window.
5- when running the tk.py from the command window a jam.grc file will be running simultaneously to open the gnu radio jamming signal blocks.
